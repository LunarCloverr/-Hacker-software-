# Hacker Simulation Software

This repository contains Python-based terminal programs that simulate various "hacker-like" activities. These programs are designed purely for entertainment purposes and to give users a fun experience in their CMD terminal.

## Included Programs

### 1. **BTC Brute Force Simulation**
- Simulates brute-forcing Bitcoin wallet keys.
- Generates random Bitcoin wallet addresses and private keys.
- Displays progress interactively with typing effects.
- Uses color-coded output for success and failure messages.

### 2. **Wi-Fi Password Cracker Simulation**
- Simulates cracking Wi-Fi passwords.
- Generates random SSIDs (Wi-Fi network names) and passwords.
- Displays brute-force attempts with a chance of success.
- Includes a realistic typing effect for added drama.

### 3. **Port Scanner Simulation**
- Simulates scanning open ports on a random IP address.
- Displays a list of "open" ports with associated services (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
- Uses a random number generator to determine open ports.
- Includes a typing effect to enhance the experience.

### 4. **Database Hack Simulation**
- Simulates hacking a database and extracting user credentials.
- Generates random usernames and passwords.
- Displays extracted credentials in real time.
- Includes color-coded output and typing effects.
